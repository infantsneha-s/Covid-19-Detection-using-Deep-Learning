# Covid-19-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

This project detects covid-19 from chest x-ray images using deep learning model like DenseNet-201 along with SVM.

We initially augmented the chest x-ray images with DCGAN.
Then, we passed the augmented images to DenseNet-201 and SVM.
We compared this model with several other models like DenseNet-201 along with Random Forest with augmentation, DenseNet-201 without any augmentation and also compared with a Simple CNN model.
